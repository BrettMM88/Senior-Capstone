# Senior Capstone
This was my senior capstone project for Kansas Wesleyan University. 

## Description
This project brings together the power of google maps with weather information provided by [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/).

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a single user interface that provides routing information along with accurate travel information based upon expected arrival times. While this could be done manually
by using seperate mapping/routing applications a single interface is much simpler.
